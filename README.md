# Express.js Route Handler: Missing Error Handling and Input Validation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling and lack of input validation.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The original code lacks proper error handling for scenarios such as invalid user IDs or database errors.  It also doesn't validate user input, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file addresses these issues by:

1. Validating the user ID to ensure it's a number.
2. Implementing comprehensive error handling for cases where a user is not found.
3. Adding more specific error messages to improve debugging and user experience.
